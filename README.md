# Sorted-list-implementation

This repo includes three files. 
- Main.java is a driver file that generates a random list of integers and times how long it takes to the methods in the SortedList.java file. 
- List.java includes an abstract class that outlines all the methods needed to implement in SortedList.java.
- SortedList.java includes recursive implementation for the following methods:
  - Insert
  - Retrieve
  - Remove
  - Search
  - Utilizes a linked-list data structure to hold the numbers and implement these methods

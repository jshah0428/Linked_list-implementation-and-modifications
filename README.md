# Sorted-list-implementation

This repo includes three files. 
- Main.java is a driver file that generates a random list of integers and times for how long it takes to run the various methods. 
- List.java includes an abstract class that outlines all the methods needed to implement the list of numbers.
- SortedList.java includes recursive implementation for the methods outlined in the List.java file, and all of then changes occur onto a linked-list structure
